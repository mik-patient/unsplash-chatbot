To run the completed Chatbot code locally or deploy it to a live server, continue reading below.



## Local/Development Setup

To run the completed Chatbot locally, follow these steps,

1. In terminal:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/zoom/unsplash-chatbot.git`

   `$ cd unsplash-chatbot`

   `$ npm install`

   `$ touch .env`

   [Download PostgreSQL here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or if on a Mac install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/),

   `$ brew install postgresql`

   Once PostgreSQL is installed, follow these commands if you haven’t set it up before,

   `$ brew services start postgresql`

   `$ psql postgres`

   You should be inside the PostgreSQL terminal now and see a `postgres=#` preifx. Now let’s create a database user called "me" with a password of "password"

   `postgres=# CREATE ROLE me WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';`

   `postgres=# ALTER ROLE me CREATEDB;`

   `postgres=# \q`

   You have just added yourself as a user who has the create database permission. Now type this to connect to postgres as your user,

   `$ psql -d postgres -U me`

   Now that PostgreSQL is configured, let’s create a database, connect to it, and create a table to store our access_token. We will also seed our database with a blank access_token and an expires_on date of 1. That way, the first time we call our Zoom Chatbot it will think the access_token is expired. Then it will generate a new one for us, and save it. Run these postgres commands,

   `postgres=> CREATE DATABASE zoom_chatbot;`

   `postgres=> \c zoom_chatbot`

   `zoom_chatbot=> CREATE TABLE chatbot_token (token TEXT,  expires_on NUMERIC);`

   `zoom_chatbot=> INSERT INTO chatbot_token (token, expires_on)  VALUES ('', '1');`

2. Add this code to your `.env` file, replacing the `Required` text with your respective [**Development** Zoom Chatbot API credentials](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/getting-started/app-types/create-chatbot-app#register) and your [Unsplash Access Key](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications).

   If you followed my instructions on setting up PostgreSQL, don't change the `DATABASE_URL`. If you have setup PostgreSQL before or set it up differently than me reference this `postgres://DBUSERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT/DATABASE`.

   ```
   unsplash_access_key=Required
   zoom_client_id=Required
   zoom_client_secret=Required
   zoom_bot_jid=Required
   zoom_verification_token=Required
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://me:password@localhost:5432/zoom_chatbot
   ```


3. In terminal:

   `$ npm run start` or `$ nodemon` ([for live reload / file change detection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon))

   `$ ngrok http 4000` ([ngrok turns localhost into live server](https://ngrok.com/) so slash commands and user actions can be sent to your app)

5. Open your ngrok https url in a browser, you should see this,

   `Welcome to the Unsplash Chatbot for Zoom!`

6. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, add your ngrok https url to your Whitelist URLs (App Credentials Page), **Development** Redirect URL for OAuth (App Credentials Page), and **Development** Bot Endpoint URL (Features Page). Make sure to match the path after your ngrok https url with the express routes in index.js.

   > In order to click the **Save** button on the Features page when adding a Slash Command and Development Bot Endpoint URL, you have to provide a Production Bot Endpoint URL. Feel free to use https://zoom.us as a placeholder.

   After that, your app is ready to be installed!

7. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, go to the **Local Test** page and click **Install**. After you click the **Authorize** button, you should be taken to your redirect url and see this,

   `Thanks for installing the Unsplash Chatbot for Zoom!`


8. Now that your Chatbot is installed on your Zoom account, go to a Zoom Chat channel and type,

   `/unsplash mountains`


## Production Setup

To run the completed Chatbot on a live server, follow these steps,

1. Click the **Deploy to Heroku** Button,

   [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

2. Fill in your [**Production** Zoom Chatbot API credentials](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/getting-started/app-types/create-chatbot-app#register) and your [Unsplash Access Key](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications) in the **Config Vars** section.

3. Click **Deploy app**.

4. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, add your Heroku url to your Whitelist URLs (App Credentials Page), **Production** Redirect URL for OAuth (App Credentials Page), and **Production** Bot Endpoint URL (Features Page). Make sure to match the path after your Heroku url with the express routes in index.js.

5. On your App Marketplace Dashboard, go to the **Submit** page and click **Add to Zoom**. After you click the **Authorize** button, you should be taken to your redirect url and see this,

   `Thanks for installing the Unsplash Chatbot for Zoom!`

6. Now that your Chatbot is installed on your Zoom account, go to a Zoom Chat channel and type,

   `/unsplash mountains`
